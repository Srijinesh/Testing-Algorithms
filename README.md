# Testing-Algorithms
Description of  algorithm for the grading of a student based on his marks

Step 1: Start Testing Algorithm
Step 2: Accept the student marks as input(a floating point number or an integer out of 100)
Step 3: Using multiple decision control statements analyse given marks and output the relevant grade
      a. If score is above 90, output the grade as 'A' 
      b. If score is above 80 and less than or equal to 90, output the grade 'B'
      c. If score is above 75 and less than or equal to 80, output the grade'C'
      d. If score is less than 75 and above 35, output the grade 'D'
      e. If score is below 35, output the grade 'FAIL'
Step 4: Stop
